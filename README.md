$ conan install libjpeg/8c@bzzzil/stable
```

### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*

```
[requires]
libjpeg/8c@bzzzil/stable

[options]
libjpeg:shared=true # false

[generators]
txt
cmake
```

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:</small></span>

```
conan install .
```

Project setup installs the library (and all his dependencies) and generates the files *conanbuildinfo.txt* and *conanbuildinfo.cmake* with all the paths and variables that you need to link with your dependencies.
